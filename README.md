# Mapping Earthquakes

The purpose of this assignment was to create a map using the MapBox API and earthquake data.
The map includes information on where tectonic plates are located, has circle markers of all earthquakes, and includes a filtered view of major earthquakes only.
The code had two tile layers and a 3rd light view was added as a contrast the street and satalite view.


### Below are previews of the mapped data and map views:
